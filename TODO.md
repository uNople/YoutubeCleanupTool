Next:
- Get the video data. See if there's something in there that tells us if it's music or video
- Investigate other parts of the api to see if the data is hidden elsewhere

Likes:
- See if I can get liked playlist from API

Other:
- consider forceGet - might need to consider separate refreshes of playlists and also just some playlist items
- Using that great power, see if I can modify the liked playlist (like a video, unlike it / delete from liked playlist)
- See if I can add to a playlist
- Re-architect program to do meet the needs of future matt (once I know what I want it to do properly)
- Write tests, have decent coverage
- Add Sqlite - not saving JSON to disk

Further things / ideas:
- Get titles, descriptions, tags, thumbnail etc for videos
- build a search
- build some kind of categorizer

Final (countdown) goal
- Some kind of tool to manage my youtube videos / playlists / likes quicker than on the website
