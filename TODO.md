Next/Current:
- Add thumbnails to database + get smallest thumb for now
- Prototype UI in WPF


After:
- Create more permanent UI in cv++ languages/frameworks
- Blazor/express
- [project reunion](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion)

Future features:
- Cache thumbnails for playlists and videos (once it's in sqlite)
- build some kind of auto-categorizer (put liked videos in specific playlist if they match things)

Final (countdown) goal
- Some kind of tool to manage my YouTube videos / playlists / likes quicker than on the website
- Ability to cache titles/other info (and not clear them when videos get deleted)
- With the Ability to differentiate between music and YouTube videos

Deferred (probably not really needed)
- Refactor YouTubeApi so it uses IAsyncEnumerable (refactoring to make slightly more responsive)
