Next:
- Cache playlist items
- Add 'force get' for this cache
- Continue "working" on differentiating between youtube music playlist vs youtube playlist

Differentiating between youtube playlist and youtube music playlist:
- Get playlists themselves (get all content, videos, better description, more metadata, something other than "snippet"?)
- Is there some way of differentiating between the playlists?

Likes:
- See if I can get liked playlist from API

Other:
- Using that great power, see if I can modify the liked playlist (like a video, unlike it / delete from liked playlist)
- See if I can add to a playlist
- Re-architect program to do meet the needs of future matt (once I know what I want it to do properly)
- Write tests, have decent coverage

Further things / ideas:
- Get titles, descriptions, tags, thumbnail etc for videos
- build a search
- build some kind of categorizer

Final (countdown) goal
- Some kind of tool to manage my youtube videos / playlists / likes quicker than on the website
