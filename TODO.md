Next:
- Add Sqlite - not saving JSON to disk -> EF core
- Write tests, have decent coverage

After?
- Create some kind of UI for what I have (Razer/express?)
- Re-architect program
    - Have some kind of 'SearchableField' attribute for later

Future features:
- Make a UI to modify my playlists easier than through youtube
- Cache thumbnails for playlists and videos (once it's in sqlite)
- build a search (make sure we're saving all the data we would want to search on)
- build some kind of auto-categorizer (put liked videos in specific playlist if they match things)

Final (countdown) goal
- Some kind of tool to manage my youtube videos / playlists / likes quicker than on the website
- Ability to cache titles/other info (and not clear them when videos get deleted)
- With the Ability to differentiate between music and youtube videos
