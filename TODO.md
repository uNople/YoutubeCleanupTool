- Save the data, so I don't need to get it from the API all the time (cost savings)
  eg, JSON serialize/deserialize
  Read it in if it's there, or a 'force' has been passed in
- Make sure I can get the liked playlist
- Get the contents of all the playlists (title of playlist, titles of videos in there, etc)


- Using that great power, see if I can modify the liked playlist (like a video, unlike it / delete from liked playlist)
- See if I can add to a playlist

Further things / ideas:
- Get the contents of all playlists
- Save them somewhere / somehow
- Get titles, descriptions, tags, thumbnail etc for videos
- build a search
- build some kind of categorizer


Final (countdown) goal
- Some kind of tool to manage my youtube videos / playlists / likes quicker than on the website
