# Youtube cleanup tool

# What is it
A tool to clean google play music / youtube music likes out of liked youtube playlist

# Why ???

Because I only want my liked videos in my liked videos playlist. If I wanted music there, I would have liked it on youtube myself

It's also super slow to do anything with playlists, especially when they're massive like mine

# how to run

First, you need a api key, and a oauth key.
Follow the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect

Go to Credential manager (Control Panel -> User Accounts -> Credential Manager)

1. Create a `googleapikey` generic credential
   The 'password' field for this should be your google api key
2. Download the JSON for your oauth, and put it in the place that's read in
